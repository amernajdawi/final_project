COMPLETENESS Account for and report on all GHG emission sources and activities within the chosen inventory boundary. Disclose and justify any specific exclusions. CONSISTENCY Use consistent methodologies to allow for meaningful comparisons of emissions over time. Transparently document any changes to the data, inventory boundary, methods, or any other relevant factors in the time series. TRANSPARENCY Address all relevant issues in a factual and coherent manner, based on a clear audit trail. Disclose any relevant assumptions and make appropriate references to the accounting and calculation methodologies and data sources used. ACCURACY Ensure that the quantification of GHG emissions is systematically neither over nor under actual emissions, as far as can be judged, and that uncertainties are reduced as far as practicable. Achieve sufficient accuracy to enable users to make decisions with reasonable assurance as to the integrity of the reported information.

GHG trading programs are likely to impose additional layers of accounting specificity relating to which approach is used for setting organizational boundaries; which GHGs and sources are addressed; how base years are established; the type of calculation method- ology used; the choice of emission factors; and the monitoring and verification approaches employed. The broad participation and best practices incorporated into the GHG Protocol Corporate Standardare likely to inform the accounting requirements of emerging programs, and have indeed done so in the past. Recognition for early voluntary action A credible inventory may help ensure that a corpora- tion\u2019s early, voluntary emissions reductions are recognized in future regulatory programs. To illustrate, suppose that in 2000 a company started reducing its GHG emissions by shifting its on-site powerhouse boiler fuel from coal to landfill gas. If a mandatory GHG reduction program is later established in 2005 and it sets 2003 as the base against which reductions are to be measured, the program might not allow the emissions reductions achieved by the green power project prior to 2003 to count toward its target. However, if a company\u2019s voluntary emissions reductions have been accounted for and registered, they are more likely to be recognized and taken into account when regulations requiring reductions go into effect. For instance, the state of California has stated that it will use its best efforts to ensure that organizations that register certified emission results with the California Climate Action Registry receive appropriate considera- tion under any future international, federal, or state regulatory program relating to GHG emissions.

In addition to the six Kyoto gases, companies may also provide emissions data for other GHGs (e.g., Montreal Protocol gases) to give context to changes in emission levels of Kyoto Protocol gases. Switching from a CFC to HFC, for example, will increase emissions of Kyoto Protocol gases. Information on emissions of GHGs other than the six Kyoto gases may be reported separately from the scopes in a GHG public report. Together the three scopes provide a comprehensive accounting framework for managing and reducing direct and indirect emissions. Figure 3 provides an overview of the relationship between the scopes and the activities that generate direct and indirect emissions along a company\u2019s value chain. A company can benefit from efficiency gains throughout the value chain. Even without any policy drivers, accounting for GHG emissions along the value chain may reveal potential for greater efficiency and lower costs (e.g., the use of fly ash as a clinker substitute in the manufacture of cement that reduces downstream emis- sions from processing of waste fly ash, and upstream 26 CHAPTER 4 E C N A D I U G A BOX 2.

Describe the value chain. Because the assessment of scope 3 emissions does not require a full life cycle assessment, it is important, for the sake of transparency, to provide a general description of the value chain and the associated GHG sources. For this step, the scope 3 categories listed can be used as a checklist. Companies usually face choices on how many levels up- and down- stream to include in scope 3. Consideration of the company\u2019s inventory or business goals and relevance of the various scope 3 categories will guide these choices. 2. Determine which scope 3 categories are relevant.Only some types of upstream or downstream emissions cate- gories might be relevant to the company.

Through participation in the Business Leaders Initiative on Climate Change, the company found that 98 percent of its emissions in Sweden originate from the transport of goods via outsourced partner transportation firms. Each partner is required, as an element of the subcontract payment scheme, to enter data on vehicles used, distance traveled, fuel efficiency, and background data. This data is used to calculate total emissions via a tailored calculation tool for outsourced transportation which gives a detailed picture of its scope 3 emissions. Linking data to specific carriers allows the company to screen individual carriers for environmental performance and affect decisions based on each carrier\u2019s emissions performance, which is seen through scope 3 as DHL\u2019s own performance. By including scope 3 and promoting GHG reductions throughout the value chain, DHL Express Nordic increased the relevance of its emissions footprint, expanded opportunities for reducing its impacts and improved its ability to recognize cost saving opportu- nities. Without scope 3, DHL Express Nordic would have lacked much of the information needed to be able to understand and effec- tively manage its emissions.

Organic growth/decline refers to increases or decreases in production output, changes in product mix, and closures and openings of operating units that are owned or controlled by the company.

These data are the foundation of\nInterface\u2019s annual inventory and enable data comparison over\ntime in the pursuit of improved quality.\nBasing emissions data systems on financial reporting helps\nInterface improve its data quality. Just as financial data need to\nbe documented and defensible, Interface\u2019s emissions data are\nheld to standards that promote an increasingly transparent,\naccurate, and high-quality inventory.

Second, it can help (in combination 4Statistical uncertainty results from natural variations (e.g., random with data quality investigations) identify, explain, and quantify both human errors in the measurement process and fluctuations in measure- statistical and systematic uncertainties. ment equipment). Statistical uncertainty can be detected through repeated experiments or sampling of data. 7It should be recognized, however, that biases may not be constant from year to year but instead may exhibit a pattern over time (e.g., may be growing or falling). For example, a company that continues to disinvest in collecting high quality data may create a situation in which the biases in its data get worse each year. These types of data quality issues are extremely problematic because of the effect they can have on calculated emission trends. In such cases, systematic parameter uncertainties cannot be ignored.\n\n| | | --------- | | | | | | | | G U I D A N C E | | | |\n\n |  | \n------\n8 |  | Accounting for GHG Reductions\n |  | \n", "embedding_index": 80, "page_number": 59}, {"chunk_id": "6e4e415c-6e76-4778-a082-17842373c6d3_p59_c1", "text": " worse each year.

(cid:127) PARTICIPATING IN VOLUNTARY PROGRAMS A growing number of voluntary GHG programs are emerging to encourage and assist companies in setting, implementing, and tracking progress toward GHG targets. Participation in voluntary programs can result in public recognition, may facilitate recog- nition of early action by future regulations, and enhance a company\u2019s GHG accounting and reporting capacity and understanding. Steps in Setting a Target Setting a GHG target involves making choices among various strategies for defining and achieving a GHG reduction. The business goals, any relevant policy context, and stakeholder discussions should inform these choices. The following sections outline the ten steps involved. Although presented sequentially, in practice target setting involves cycling back and forth between the steps. It is assumed that the company has developed a GHG inventory before implementing these steps. Figure 12 summarizes the steps. 1. Obtain senior management commitment As with any corporate wide target, senior management buy-in and commitment particularly at the board/CEO level is a prerequisite for a successful GHG reduction program. Implementing a reduction target is likely to necessitate changes in behavior and decision-making throughout the organization. It also requires estab- lishing an internal accountability and incentive system and providing adequate resources to achieve the target. This will be difficult, if not impossible, without senior management commitment. E C N A D I U G Setting a GHG Target BOX 4.

The quality of the GHG inventory should be a key factor informing this choice. The questions to be addressed in this step include the following: (cid:127) WHICH GHGS? Targets usually include one or more of the six major GHGs covered by the Kyoto Protocol. For companies with significant non-CO GHG sources 2 it usually makes sense to include these to increase the range of reduction opportunities. However, practical monitoring limitations may apply to smaller sources. (cid:127) WHICH GEOGRAPHICAL OPERATIONS? Only country or regional operations with reliable GHG inventory data should be included in the target. For companies with global operations, it makes sense to limit the target\u2019s geographical scope until a robust and reli- able inventory has been developed for all operations. Companies that participate in GHG programs involving trading2 will need to decide whether or not to include the emissions sources covered in the trading program in their corporate target. If common sources are included, i.e., if there is overlap in sources covered between the corporate target and the trading program, companies should consider how they will address anydouble counting resulting from the trading of GHG reductions in the trading program (see step 8). (cid:127) WHICH DIRECT AND INDIRECT EMISSION SOURCES? Including indirect GHG emissions in a target will facilitate more cost-effective reductions by increasing the reduction opportunities available. However, indirect emissions are generally harder to measure accurately and verify than direct emissions although some categories, such as scope 2 emissions from purchased electricity, may be amenable to accurate measurement and verification. Including indirect emissions can raise issues with regard to ownership and double counting of reductions, as indirect emis- sions are by definition someone else\u2019s direct emissions (see step 8). (cid:127) SEPARATE TARGETS FOR DIFFERENT TYPES OF BUSINESSES? For companies with diverse operations it may make more sense to define separate GHG targets for different core businesses, especially when using an intensity target, where the most meaningful business metric for defining the target varies across business units (e.g., GHGs per tonne of cement produced or barrel of oil refined).

In this example, company A acquires company B, which has experienced organic GHG growth since the target base year (or \u201cstarting\u201d year). Under the rolling approach, emissions growth in the acquired company (B) from year 1 to year 2 does not appear as an emissions increase in relation to the target of the acquiring company (A). Thus company A would meet its stabilization target when using the rolling approach but not when using the fixed approach. In parallel to the example in chapter 5, past GHG growth or decline in divested facilities (GHG changes before the divestment) would affect the target performance under the rolling approach, while it would not be counted under the fixed approach. commitment period). In other words, its average emissions over those five years must not exceed FIGURE 15. Short vs. long commitment periods 90 percent of year 2000 emissions. Target commitment periods longer than one year can 1 year be used to mitigate the risk of unpredictable events in one particular year influencing performance against the target. Figure 15 shows that the length of the target commitment period determines how many emis- sions are actually relevant for target performance. For a target using a rolling base year, the commitment period applies throughout: emission performance is continuously being measured against the target every year from when the target is set until the target 5 years completion date. 7.

In this case, a company still needs to use EFG to report its scope 2 emissions for a GHG report prepared in accordance with GHG Protocol Corporate Standard. | | | | | | A P P E N D I X A | | |\n\nB |  | Accounting for Sequestered Atmospheric Carbon\n----------------------------------------------------\n |  | \n | X\nI\nD\nN\nE\nP\nP\nA | \n |  | \n |  | \n |  | \n |  | \n |  | \n |  | \n |  | \n |  | \n |  | \n |  | \n |  | \n |  | \n |  | \n |  | \n |  | \n |  | \n |  | \n |  | \n |  | \n |  | \n |  | \n\n\n |  | \n------\n |  | \n |  | \n\n\nC |  | OOvveerrvviieeww ooff GGHHGG PPrrooggrraammss\n----------------------------------------------------\n |  | \n | X\nI\nD\nN\nE\nP\nP\nA | \n |  | \n\nNAME OF PROGRAM TYPE OF PROGRAM FOCUS GASE", "embedding_index": 115, "page_number": 89}, {"chunk_id": "6e4e415c-6e76-4778-a082-17842373c6d3_p89_c4", "text": " | \n\n\n |  | \n------\n |  | \n |  | \n\n\nC |  | OOvveerrvviieeww ooff GGHHGG PPrrooggrraammss\n----------------------------------------------------\n |  | \n | X\nI\nD\nN\nE\nP\nP\nA | \n |  | \n\nNAME OF PROGRAM TYPE OF PROGRAM FOCUS GASES COVERED ORGANIZATIONAL\n(Organization, PROJECT BOUNDARIES |  |  |  | \nproject, facility) |  |  |  | \nCalifornia Climate Action Registry\nwww.climateregisty.org | Voluntary registry | Organization\n(Projects possible\nin 2004) | Organizations report\nCO for first three\n2\nyears of participa-\ntion,all six\nGHGs thereafter. | Equity share or control for\nCalifornia or US operations\nUS EPA Climate Leaders\nwww.epa.gov/climateleaders | Voluntary reduction\nprogram | Organization | Six | Equity share or control\nfor US operations\nat a minimum\nWWF Climate Savers\nwww.worldwildlife.org/climatesavers | Voluntary registry | Organization | CO\n2 | Equity share or control\nfor worldwide operations\nWorld Economic Forum\nGlobal GHG Register\nwww.weforum.org | Voluntary registry | Organization | Six | Equity share or control for\nworldwide operations\nEU GHG Emissions Allowance\nTrading Scheme\nwww.europa.eu.int/comm/environment/ | Mandatory allowance\ntrading scheme | Facility | Six | Facilities in\nselected sectors\nEuropean Pollutant\nEmission Registry\nwww.europa.eu.int/comm/environ-\nment/ippc/eper/index.htm | Mandatory registry\nfor large industrial\nfacilities | Facility | Six Kyoto gases\nas well as other\npollutants | Facilities that fall under\nEU IPPC directive\nChicago Climate Exchange\nwww.chicagoclimateexchange.com | Voluntary allowance\ntrading scheme | Organization\nand project | Six | Equity share\nRespect Europe BLICC\nwww.respecteurope.com/rt2/blicc/ | Voluntary reduction\nprogram | Organization | Six | Equity share or control for\nworldwide operations\n", "embedding_index": 116, "page_number": 89}, {"chunk_id": "6e4e415c-6e76-4778-a082-17842373c6d3_p92_c0", "text": "FOCUS GASES COVERED ORGANIZATIONAL (Organization, PROJECT BOUNDARIES project, facility) Organization Organizations report Equity share or control for (Projects possible CO for first three California or US operations 2 in 2004) years of participa- tion,all six GHGs thereafter.

(Chapter 11) Uncertainty 1. Statistical definition: A parameter associated with the result of a measurement that characterizes the dispersion of the values that could be reasonably attributed to the measured quantity. (e.g., the sample variance or coefficient of variation). (Chapter 7) 2. Inventory definition: A general and imprecise term which refers to the lack of certainty in emissions- related data resulting from any causal factor, such as the application of non-representative factors or methods, incomplete data on sources and sinks, lack of transparency etc. Reported uncertainty information typically specifies a quantitative estimates of the likely or perceived difference between a reported value and a qualitative description of the likely causes of the difference.
